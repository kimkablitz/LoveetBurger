# LoveetBurger

* A restaurant app demonstrates full-stack skills in all aspects, from client to server side, using mySQL with ORM library, Node JS and manipulate tables with Javascript via handlebars of the front end. When user enter an item name of their choice (a burger), this information will be sent to burgers database of mySQL, and then rendered on the page instantly.
* The use of ORM libary allows developers to manipulate the database indirectly and at a much faster speed.
* Handlebars saves us from having to repeat the same codes in DOM
